this probelm we are given a list and 2 ints a lower and a upper
we are to give all the ranges from the first index to the next index
we do this from the lower to the upper

for the solution we are going to have a var that will essentially 
check the values as we iterate over the list, to starrt we set it to the 
given lower int since this will be our starting place
then we will make a list to store these ranges as we go

so we are going to iterate the length of the incoming list
if our item/num is greater than the number check this means our check
is the lowest range so far so we append [check, item] to our storage list
then we set the new number check num + 1
now we just need to handle for when we reach the upper, so we will see
if the number check is less than or greater than the upper
and we will add that to our list or greater than the upper
