680. Valid Palindrome II

given a string return true or false if the string can be palindrome after deleting AT MOST ONE character from it

Example 1:

Input: s = "aba"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "abca"
Output: true
Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.

Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: false

---THOUGHTS---
another task of string manipulation

my initial thought is to first just check if its a palindrome
to do this make a copy of the string rearrage the new word and the original string in alphabetical order (or some identical way) and see if there are equal

the tricky part is to see if we can remove a letter. I'm thinking maybe use 2 pointers to go through each index but not really sure

after discussing with Mr.Gpt it seems my 2 pointer hunch was correct but instead of creating a copy i can just create 2 pointers within the string and slowly work my way in checking for matches

if I find a mismatch I will try to remove the right one check if its valid and if not I will remove the left one and if its not 
valid I will return false otherwise if it is then I will continue till its completes and if I can complete the iterations I will return true
