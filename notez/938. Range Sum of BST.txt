938. Range Sum of BST

Given the root node of a binary search tree and two integers low and high, return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range [low, high].

    10
   /  \
  5    15
 / \     \
3   7     18

input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], low = 7, high = 15
Output: 32
Explanation: Nodes 7, 10, and 15 are in the range [7, 15]. 7 + 10 + 15 = 32.

 #THOUGHTS
i need to traverse the binary tree not totally sure how to accomplish this in code im guessing I need to keep going left until I cant anymor then go right? the tree is a given array so Im guessing i can make an array and push all the numbers between the low and high int intoo to an array as im checking them?
