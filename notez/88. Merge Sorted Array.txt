for this problem we are given 2 lists nums1 and nums2 and 2 integers m and n
we are to merge the sorted arrays in place. ints m and n represent how many 
item from each list will return [nums1, m] [nums2,n]

in this solution we set a pointer called 'last' which represents the last index
in the merged array then we will iterate through our given ints to ensure 
we are with in the range of the fully merged array.
now we need set our values are in a non-decreasing order. 
we basically are gonna use 2 points nums[m - 1] and nums2[n - 1] and work 
backwards adding in numbers from nums2 into the nums1 one list
techinally in a decreasing order since we are going backwards
then finally we splice in nums 2 to the end if there are remaning characters
